# Blinkit Sales Analysis — Excel Dashboard Project
## Project Overview
This project is a complete Excel-based data analysis of Blinkit’s grocery sales. It includes an interactive dashboard, visual insights, KPIs, and pivot-table–driven analysis to understand sales performance across multiple dimensions such as outlet type, item type, fat content, location, establishment year, and store size.
The dashboard allows users to explore the data using filters and slicers, making it easy to uncover patterns, trends, and business insights.
